The pi successfully boots and prints a command prompt to the screen. The LED
functions, the print functions, and the wait function from the baking pi
tutorials can all be called from a C program at this point.

To get the toolchain you need to be able to compile the OS use the following
3 commands:

1) wget http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/freshers/raspberrypi/tutorials/os/downloads/arm-none-eabi.tar.bz2

2) tar xjvf arm-none-eabi.tar.bz2

3) export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/arm-2008q3/bin
