IPC documentation

Implementations of system calles related to IPC are as follows:


The Send Function, which also can recieve
	unsigned long long internal_send(unsigned int a0, unsigned int a1,
		unsigned int a2, unsigned int a3, unsigned int a4)
	Parameters used are a0, a1, a2, a3,

The Get Reply from Sender Function
	unsigned long long internal_get_reply(unsigned int a0, unsigned int a1,
		unsigned int a2, unsigned int a3, unsigned int a4)
	Parameters used are a0, a1, a2,

The Wait For Sender Function
	unsigned long long internal_wait_for_send(unsigned int a0, unsigned int a1,
		unsigned int a2, unsigned int a3, unsigned int a4)
	No Parameters are used in this function.
	
The Recieve Function
	unsigned long long internal_receive(unsigned int a0, unsigned int a1,
		unsigned int a2, unsigned int a3, unsigned int a4)
	Parameters used are a0, a1, a2.

The Reply Function
	unsigned long long internal_reply(unsigned int a0, unsigned int a1,
		unsigned int a2, unsigned int a3, unsigned int a4)
	Parameters used are a0, a1, a2/
	
The parameters are only used when necessary, if they are unneeded they are
unused in their respective function. The Parameters are as follows:
	a0 is the PID of the target process
	a1 is the pointer to the data to send
	a2 is the size of the message
	a3 defines if the funciton will block until a reply has been given
		(if 1 then block, else don't block)
	a4 is currently unused by all functions.
